Good morning. Miss Thompson. How have you been feeling since your last visit? Good morning doctor. Well, I've been feeling a bit tired lately more than usual.  I see. Can you tell me a little more about that have there been any changes in your diet sleep or stress levels? My diet hasn't changed much, but I have been struggling to get a good night sleep. I've been feeling stressed because of work stress can certainly impact your sleep and overall energy levels. Have you tried any relaxation techniques or exercises to help with your sleep? I've tried some breathing exercises before bed, but they don't always help it's good that you're trying those exercise can also Aid in better sleep. We can discuss some strategies that might work for you now, have you experienced any other symptoms headaches dizziness or anything out of the ordinary now that you mention it, I've had had occasional headaches over the last few weeks.  Are these headaches occurring or any particular time of the day?  Mostly mid-afternoon sometimes earlier if I had a tough night. All right. I'm going to do a physical examination and run some routine blood test to check your thyroid function blood sugar levels and potential areas that could be affecting your energy causing these headaches depending on the results. We may also look into your patterns more closely possibly a sleep study sleep study. Does that sound okay to you? Yes, that sounds good. I just want to figure out what's going on and feel better. Of course. We'll get to the bottom of this now. Let's start with your blood pressure and heart rate.
